Description
-----------

mf2pt1 facilitates producing PostScript Type 1 fonts from a Metafont
source file.  mf2pt1's advantage over tools such as TeXtrace and
mftrace is that it does not rely on bitmap tracing and therefore can
produce higher-quality Type 1 fonts than trace-based tools.  The catch
is that mf2pt1 imposes a number of restrictions on the Metafont input
so it is not, as the name may imply, an automatic converter of
arbitrary Metafont fonts to Type 1 format.


Installation
------------

For installation instructions, see the mf2pt1 manual (mf2pt1.pdf).

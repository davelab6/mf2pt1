        * mf2pt1.texi:
        Removed the mention of roex.mf because, according to Werner Lemberg,
        it doesn't work with MetaPost.  Inserted in its place a pointer to a

        overlap-removal library as an attachment.

        generation.

        * mf2pt1.texi:
        Documented the glyph_name command, the new way of dumping MetaPost

        the font.

        Removed; <fontname>.pe is now generated automatically by mf2pt1.pl.

        * mf2pt1.pl:
        Modified to automatically try running the output through t1asm and
        fontforge.

        * mf2pt1.pl:
        Hoisted extraction of the font extension above MF2PT1_CMD and assigned
        the value to $charnum instead of leaving it for a long time in $1.
        Renamed $dx[123]m and $dy[123]m to $dx[123]d and $dy[123]d (for
        "denominator").  Renamed "precision" to "rounding".  Added blank lines
        after each section of output.

        and $dym to $dxd and $dyd (for "denominator"); fixed the precision
        warnings; moved Werner's new functions to the top of the file with
        the others; added prototypes for those functions; and, added a SEE
        ALSO for FontForge.
